END OF LIFE
===========

I don't game on IRC anymore - I haven't touched this code in ages, and don't intend to update it.

Polyhedral
==========

A ZNC module, written in Python to provide polyhedral dice for roleplaying
games.

Support is included for Standard D&D style dice, Pool based systems (WoD,
Shadowrun), and FATE/FUDGE.

To install, copy the entire package (polyhedral/) into the ZNC module
directory.
